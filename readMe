DATA MINING PROJECT 1 - UNCERTAIN CLUSTERING

Overview

DataminingProject.jar is a Java library that permits to:
1) Generate uncertain synthetic points with the shape (id, (d1,d2,...,dn),prob), where: 
    * id: identifier 
    * d1,d2,...,dn: dimensions of the uncertain points (coordinates)
    * prob: probability that the uncertain point with identifier=id is at position (d1,d2,...,dn) 
    So, for example, given a point with id "A":
    (A,(10,20),0,8)), (A,(20,30),0.2)) will be the uncertain set of point "A". Prob must sum to 1.

    This library has three different algorithms for sampling uncertain data:
    1) Simple sampling (numberOfSamples, minValue, maxValue, highdifference): for each point generates two uncertain points having the same probability if highdifference is false;
    Different probabilities if highdifference is true
    2) Random sampling (numberOfSamples, MaxNumberOfUncertainPoints, minValue, maxValue): for each point generates a random number of uncertain points with random probabilities
    3) Poisson sampling (numberOfSamples, lambdas): each point is represented as a Poisson random variables. It will sample at random point following this distribution 

2) Transform uncertain data to certain data according to two different algorithms:
    1) MostProbable algorithm: for each point this algorithm chooses the most probable uncertain point. It is like ignoring the fact that points are uncertain and pretending that 
    the most probable one is the only value of the point.
    2) AverageDistance algorithm: for each point the algorithm computes the expected mean of the uncertain points and chooses the expected mean as the actual value.

3) Run a k-Mean algorithm on the output of MostProbable and AverageDistance methods. Note that the output of MostProbable and AverageDistance methods is a set of points without a concept of uncertainty.

4) Plot the output of clustering algorithm with 2 python scripts, one for 2D and one for 3D.

Execution

Requires java8 and python 2.7.

1) From command line run java -jar DataminingProject.jar
2) Prompt the dimension of the points
3) Prompt a sampling method 
4) Results will be stored in 2 folders: 
    1) $HOME/Documents/bdmpFiles/input/ 
    2) $HOME/Documents/bdmpFiles/output/bdmpFiles/output 
    Folder 1) contains synthetic data sampled according to the choosen method, and the "certainSet" computed with MostProbable and AverageDistance methods
    Folder 2) contains, for each uncertainty algorithm, a clustering folder.  
5) If you choose 2 or 3 dimension points, you can plot each cluster using python scripts: plotter2D.py and plotter3D.py
Usage: python [scriptname][foldername] 
So if you want to plot 2D points you will use:
python plotter2D.py average         if you want to plot clustering obtained from AverageDistance method
python plotter2D.py MostProbable    if you want to plot clustering obtained from MostProbable method
